# Multiplication Game
 

![Vezje za igro](/Circuit_bb.png)

Initialize game data by running reset_spiffs() function. 

Enable more multiplications by editing the "enabled" array in game_logic.cpp file.

Game data is stored in SPIFFS as gamedata.conf. Statistical data is stored every 100 solved equations in the stat.conf file. More work is yet to be done to be able to retrieve the data in json or csv form.
